      <p>Since he was a kid, Johnny drew.  Johnny drew scribbles and doodles and characters all day long, and the habit really hasn't ceased.  Johnny is drwan to visual characaturizations of people, concepts, as well as abstract sentimental representation.  Browse some of his work at a source that has yet to be determined (FOLLOW-UP needed.)...</p>

      <p>Johnny has been giving a lot of attention to understanding and leveraging digital technologies and past and future infrastructure.  Johnny feels that technology has the potential for great advances and evolutionary self-actualization, but the opposite potential is a very real tangent which he feels will be all too easy to manifest, and if it happens, it will likely be due to ignorance, greed, and exploitation of those without resource and capital by those who control the majority of said resources.</p>

      <p>Around the time he was in middle school, Johnny's interest in photography had emerged and he would shoot hundreds of rolls of film before he began working (not exclusively) with digitally formated cameras.  The subjects he would be drawn to were primarily people, although landscapes, street scenes, and more contextual compositions found their place in the frame.  Self-taught, Johnny never pursued commercial success in the professional photographic arena and he has tended to focus on his personally driven vision.  You can find most of his work under the alias, <em class="five">Johnny Shot Me</em>.</p>

      <p>Johnny makes gold and silver jewelry sometimes.  Sometimes he uses digital technologies, like <em>Blender</em> and a 3D printer.  Sometimes he just uses his hands (cause he strowng).  Johnny has been making jewelry for six(ish) years and he mostly enjoys the creative design and production process.  There is </p>
